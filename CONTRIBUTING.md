# How to Contribute

## Before creating a Pull Request

* Create an issue to discuss a necessity of such pull request 

## Pull Requests

* Fork the `alecrabbit/php-console-color` repository
* Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
* Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **master** branch

It is very **important** to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch. This allows us to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

## Style Guide

All pull requests must adhere to the [PSR-12 standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-12-extended-coding-style-guide.md).
